Absolutely! Here's an updated README.MD incorporating the Streamlit web app functionality:

## Women Diabetes Prediction Web App

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. It's deployed as a Streamlit web app allowing users to interact and get predictions directly.

### Getting Started

This project requires the following Python libraries:

* pandas (used for data manipulation in the original script, not required for the web app)
* numpy
* scikit-learn (used for the loaded model, not required for running the web app)
* pickle (used to load the saved model)
* streamlit

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn pickle streamlit
```

**Make sure you have a saved model file named 'trained_model.sav' in the 'C:/DeployML/' directory.**  This file is generated by the original Python script (not included here).

### Running the Web App

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using Python:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the web app in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

### Using the Web App

The web app provides a user-friendly interface for diabetes prediction. Enter the following details:

* Number of pregnancies
* Glucose level
* Blood pressure level
* Skin-thickness
* Insulin level
* BMI
* Diabetes Pedigree Function
* Age

Click the "Click for Diabetes Test Result" button to receive a prediction ("This person is non-diabetic" or "This person is diabetic").

### Project Breakdown

The original Python script for model building and evaluation is not included here. This README focuses on the Streamlit web app (`app.py`) which performs the following:

1. **Loads the saved model:** The `pickle` library is used to load the pre-trained SVM model from the 'trained_model.sav' file.
2. **Defines a prediction function (`diabetes_pred`):** This function takes user input as a list, converts it to a NumPy array, reshapes it for prediction, and uses the loaded model to predict the class (diabetic or non-diabetic).
3. **Main function (`main`):**
    * Sets the web app title ("Women Diabetes Prediction Web App").
    * Creates text input fields for each user input parameter.
    * Defines a button to trigger the prediction.
    * When the button is clicked, it calls the `diabetes_pred` function with user input and displays the prediction result as a success message.

### Additional Notes

* This web app utilizes a pre-trained model. The model building and evaluation process is not included.
* Ensure you have the 'trained_model.sav' file in the specified location.
* This is a basic implementation, and exploring different SVM kernels or feature engineering techniques might improve performance.
